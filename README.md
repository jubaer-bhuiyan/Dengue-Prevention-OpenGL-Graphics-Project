# Dengue Prevention OpenGL Graphics Project

## Overview
This is an OpenGL-based graphics project focused on raising awareness and educating users about dengue prevention. The project visually demonstrates key aspects of dengue prevention using computer graphics.

## Features
- **Interactive Graphics**: Engaging visual elements to illustrate dengue prevention measures.
- **Animations**: Dynamic mosquito movements and preventive actions.
- **OpenGL Implementation**: Built using OpenGL for rendering.
- **Educational Content**: Informative elements to spread awareness about dengue.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- OpenGL
- GLUT (OpenGL Utility Toolkit)
- A C++ Compiler (e.g., g++, MinGW, or MSVC)

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jubaer-bhuiyan/Dengue-Prevention-OpenGL-Graphics-Project.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Dengue-Prevention-OpenGL-Graphics-Project
   ```
3. **Install dependencies (if necessary):**
   - On Ubuntu/Debian:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
     ```
   - On Windows:
     - Download and install [GLUT](https://www.transmissionzero.co.uk/software/freeglut-devel/) and set up environment variables accordingly.

4. **Compile the source code:**
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o dengue_project -lGL -lGLU -lglut
   ```

5. **Run the project:**
   ```bash
   ./dengue_project
   ```

## Usage
- Launch the project and observe various dengue prevention techniques displayed through interactive animations.
- Use keyboard and mouse inputs (if applicable) to interact with the graphics.
- Learn about different mosquito control measures visually.

## Contributing
